<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: February 28, 2026</p>

<p>Welcome to Baseball Strategy Master ("the App"). By using the App, you agree to these terms. If you are under 18, a parent or guardian must agree on your behalf.</p>

<h2>What the App Does</h2>
<p>Baseball Strategy Master is an educational game that teaches baseball strategy through interactive scenarios. It is designed for players ages 6–18. The App is for educational and entertainment purposes only.</p>

<h2>Free and Pro Tiers</h2>
<p>The App offers a free tier (8 plays per day, Daily Diamond always free) and a paid Pro tier called the "All-Star Pass." The All-Star Pass costs $4.99/month or $29.99/year and unlocks unlimited plays, AI-generated scenarios, all field themes, full avatar customization, streak freeze, and 2x XP.</p>

<h2>Payments and Cancellation</h2>
<p>Payments for the All-Star Pass are processed through Stripe. Subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled. You can cancel at any time through Stripe's customer portal. Refund requests can be sent to <a href="mailto:blafleur@vested.marketing">blafleur@vested.marketing</a>.</p>

<h2>Parent Gate</h2>
<p>The Pro upgrade includes a parent gate (math verification problem) to help ensure a parent or guardian is present during the purchase process. By completing the purchase, the parent or guardian consents to the child's use of the Pro features.</p>

<h2>Content Accuracy</h2>
<p>We strive for accuracy in all baseball scenarios and explanations. However, baseball rules and strategies can vary by league and level of play. The App should be used as a learning tool alongside coaching and real game experience, not as a replacement for either.</p>

<h2>AI-Generated Content</h2>
<p>Pro users may receive AI-generated scenarios. While these are quality-checked by our system, AI content may occasionally contain inaccuracies. AI scenarios are clearly marked with a purple "AI" badge.</p>

<h2>Your Data</h2>
<p>Your game progress is stored locally on your device. You can reset your data at any time. See our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for full details on data handling.</p>

<h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>You agree to use the App for its intended educational purpose. You may not attempt to reverse engineer the App, exploit bugs for unauthorized access, or use automated tools to manipulate gameplay or promo codes.</p>

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>The App is provided "as is." We do our best to keep it running smoothly, but we cannot guarantee uninterrupted service. We are not liable for any loss of game progress due to browser data clearing or technical issues.</p>

<h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these terms as the App evolves. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
